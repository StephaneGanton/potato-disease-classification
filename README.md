# Potatoes leaf Disease classifier

## Description

In this project, we trained an ML Model to classify potatoes leaf disease. Basically, we provide an image to our model that will tell us if the leaf is infected or not. Three classes are are available : `Early Blight, LAate Blight` and `Healthy`. For this purpose, we used the [Plant Village dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village/discussion/425047?resource=download). The daset contains images of different fruit but we only use `potato images`.

To test our model and make it easier for use, we make a web page using `Fast Api` and `vueJs` were user can drag in drop an image to classify.
